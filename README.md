This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in TypeScript related to date handling.  The `greet` function in `bug.ts` accepts a date object; however, it lacks robust error handling or input validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime exceptions if an invalid date or a non-date object is passed as an argument. The `bugSolution.ts` file presents an improved version of the function with better error handling and input validation.
